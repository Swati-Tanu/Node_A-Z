//Databases are of two types: 1.SQL: Structured Query Language. 2.No SQL: Not a Structured Query Language.

//In MongoDB: Table is called Collection, Row is Document and Column is Fields.

//Query: It is used to give dynamic responses. Eg; ?name=Tanu
//Params: It is also used to give dynamic responses. Eg; /student/class

//The difference is we don't need to specify a query in url but in case of param it is necessary.
