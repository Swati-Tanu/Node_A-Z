    <!--Node.js is a JavaSript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JS engine for executing JS code. It is neither a framework nor a language. Written in C++. Using it we can run JS on the server too. Created by Google's engineer Ryan Dahl.-->
    
    <!--Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronously.-->

    <!--REPL feature: Read-Eval-Print-Loop: It is very useful in experimenting with Node.js codes and to debug JS codes. It is some what similar to cmd in windows.
    
    It enables : 1. Multiline code 2. JS Expression 3. Use variable 4. Use (_) to get the last result 5. we can use editor mode-->

    <!--Node.js Modules: File-based, Core Modules, External Node Modules.
    1.File-based Modules: We can access any file using module.export and require function.
    2.Core Modules: Built-in Modules (part of core Node). Eg; path, fs, os, http, util, etc.
    3.External Node Modules: Third party modules. Eg; API, NPM, node_modules folder, etc.-->

    <!--FUN FACT: console.log() is probably one of the most used commands by JavaScript beginners and veterans alike. But it isnâ€™t part of the JavaScript Language itself. console.log() works under run-time environment, that means it is supported by chrome's V8 engine that is why we are able to run it. In reality console.log() is not a part of JS. (.editor)-->
