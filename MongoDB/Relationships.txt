Relationships: The link or bond between two things.

Thing: people, objects, network, computers

    ==> Database ==> masai
        ==> Collection ==> Multiple Collections ==> emps, hr, marketing, curriculum, sales, community
            ==> Documents

In our case we are going to study about the link/bond (relationship) between ddifferent collections in a DB.

Types of Relationships
    1. 1 - 1 Relationship
    2. 1 - Many Relationship
    3. Many - Many Relationship

Why do we need relationships?
    Masai School Example
     1. Students
     2. Instructors

    *Student's Collection* ==> Documents
    _id:"------"
    student_code
    batch

    *Instructor's Collection* ==> Documents
    _id:"-------"
    emp_code
    sub
    exp
    department

    db.students.find({city:"BLR"}) ==> Student's Data
    db.instructors.find({city:"BLR"}) ==> Instructor's Data
    db.operations.find({city:"BLR"})

    *user's Collection*
    name
    email
    gender
    age
    blood group
    phone number
    city

1 - 1 Relationship

    *Student's Collection* ==> Documents
    _id:"------"
    student_code
    batch

    *user's Collection* ==> Documents
     _id:"------"
    name
    email
    gender
    age
    blood group
    phone number
    city

    1st Way: Put the user id in Student's Schema
    2nd: Way: Put the student id in user's schema

1 - Many Relationship

    Linkedin:
        ==> Posts => db.posts.find().pretty()
        ==> Comment Collection 
        {}

        posts=[
            {
                id:1
                title:"First Post"
                body:"Post Body"
                no_of_likes: 45
                no_of_reactions:56
                comments:[1,2,3,4]
            },
            {
                id:2
                title:"First Post"
                body:"Post Body"
                no_of_likes: 45
                no_of_reactions:56
                comments:[23,34,56]
            },
            {
                id:3
                title:"First Post"
                body:"Post Body"
                no_of_likes: 45
                no_of_reactions:56
                comments:[34,45,67]
            },
            20000
        ]

    Because 1 Post can have multiple comments

    1st Way: Put the Post id in comments schema
    2nd way: Put the comment id in post schema

Many - Many Relationship

    Question: How to program a server? ==> nodejs, java, express, http

    One tag can be used in multiple questions
    one question can have multiple tags as well

What is the best way to connect collections?

    ==> Finding out the dependent and independent collection

    1 - 1 Relationship
        ==> Dependent: Student Collection
        ==> Independent: User Collection

            ==> Put user id in student's schema

    1 - Many Relationship
        ==> Dependent: Comments Collection
        ==> Independent: Posts Collection        

            ==> Put post id in comment's schema

Consclusion ==> PUT THE INDEPENDT'S ID INSIDE DEPENDENT'S SCHEMA (PARENT'S ID IN CHILD'S SCHEMA)
